# ESP32 Projects on Wokwi

This repository contains three ESP32 example projects created and simulated using the [Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/) platform. Each project demonstrates a fundamental concept of working with ESP32 microcontrollers.  

## Examples

### 1. Blinking LED  
This example demonstrates how to blink an LED connected to the ESP32.  
- **Purpose:** Learn how to use GPIO pins to control an LED.  
- **Simulation Link:** [Blinking LED](https://wokwi.com/projects/415807653405498369)  

### 2. Reading Analog Value of a Potentiometer  
This example shows how to read the analog value of a potentiometer using the ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) on the ESP32.  
- **Purpose:** Understand how to interface analog sensors with ESP32.  
- **Simulation Link:** [Read Analog Value of Potentiometer](https://wokwi.com/projects/415812356140451841)  

### 3. Temperature Sensor Reading  
This example demonstrates how to read data from a temperature sensor connected to the ESP32.  
- **Purpose:** Learn how to interface a sensor and process its data.  
- **Simulation Link:** [Temperature Sensor Reading](https://wokwi.com/projects/415815447237870593)  

## Tools and Requirements
- [Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/) online simulator  
- Basic understanding of ESP32 GPIO and ADC functionality
